## Linz workshop (June 2022)

In this workshop we use an ESP32-S2 board to send data from self-made sensors and a motion sensor (MPU6050) via WiFi and OSC. This data can be received by e.g. Processing, SuperCollider, or Puredata, or MobMuPlatform (Pd on a phone).

## Taipei workshop (May 2022)

In this workshop we use the [Sense/Stage MiniBee](https://sensestage.eu/minibee) to receive data from self-made sensors on kites, as well as the onboard accelerometer.

For presentation slides:
